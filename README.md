# DemonRoulette

Some kind of a Geometry Dash demon roulette, that supports easy-extreme demons.

If you are doing extremes its recemmended to use [other tool](https://matcool.github.io/extreme-demon-roulette/)

!! not working, use 1.3 release until an issue can be fixed and merged into 1.5 !! (will use outdated demons but at least it works)
